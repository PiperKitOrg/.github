# Piper

**NoSQL to SQL database migration made simple, powerful, and developer-first.**

Piper is a groundbreaking, extensible toolchain for handling complex database migrations across multiple systems — built for real-world scale, speed, and sanity. Whether you’re working in startups or at enterprise scale, Piper is designed to make migrations painless.

## Repositories

This organization is structured into three core components:

### 🔧 `piper-core`
**Backend API** – Built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com)

The heart of the Piper platform. This service will handle migration logic, database connectors, metadata management, and orchestration.

### 🎛️ `piper-ui`
**Frontend Interface** – Built with [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org)

A modern, intuitive web UI for managing migrations, reviewing diffs, and visualizing change history across environments.

### 🖥️ `piper-cli`
**Command-line Interface** – Built with [Python](https://www.python.org)

For developers who prefer speed and terminal power. The CLI will support local development workflows, migration generation, and execution from the command line.

## ⚠️ Status

Piper is under **active development**. All three repositories are currently being scaffolded — stay tuned for initial commits and architecture docs.
